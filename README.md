# Cervical-Cancer-Classification
Implemented a comprehensive image classification pipeline for cervical cancer detection using various CNN architectures (Simple CNN, ResNet50, AlexNet, EfficientNet B3, Wide ResNet50).
- Added data preprocessing steps including image extraction and labeling.
- Integrated training and evaluation functions with early stopping mechanism.
- Saved trained models to the 'Models' directory for future use.
- Included performance metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall, along with confusion matrix visualization."git commit -m "Add image classification model implementation and save trained models
